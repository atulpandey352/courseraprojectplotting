 	In this project i have plotted 4 graphs with variables named as 

 data      = The data given with 9 columns , which is later subsetted as per the requirements.
 datentime = A new vector created by joining date and time column of each row .
	     And then its class is changed to POSIXlt from cahrachter.
 dnt       = data frame of single column which is  made from datentime   
             and later merged columnwise with data as its 10th column using function cbind()



 ----------------------PLOT1-------------------------------------------
1.Download the data
2.Subset the data (1/2/2007 to 2/2/2007)
3.Plot the histogram of 3rd column using hist() function with red colour 

------------------------PLOT2------------------------------------------

1.Download the data
2.Subset the data (1/2/2007 to 2/2/2007)
3.Make a new vector "datentime" with date and time combined of each row and class as POSIXlt
4.Combine the new vector with the data given as its 10th column and name "dnt"
5. Plot graph using plot() which is "global active power" vs "dnt" ( 3rd column and 10th column )

1.Download the data
2.Subset the data (1/2/2007 to 2/2/2007)
3.Make a new vector "datentime" with date and time combined of each row and class as POSIXlt
4.Combine the new vector with the data given as its 10th column and name "dnt"
5.Plot graph
6. add lines and legend 



------------------PLOT 4--------------------------------------------------------

1.Download the data
2.Subset the data (1/2/2007 to 2/2/2007)
3.Make a new vector "datentime" with date and time combined of each row and class as POSIXlt
4.Combine the new vector with the data given as its 10th column and name "dnt"
5.Set the global parametres 
6.Then plot the 4 graphs
